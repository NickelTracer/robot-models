All Robots were calculated with both forward and inverse kinematics. Models made in SolidWorks

Robot1 - 5DOF manipulator designed to cath and move objects, tools or specialized devices through various programmable motions in order to complete variety of tasks. End effector can be gripper on spraying gun. Can be used as car assembler, robot-painter or robot working in storages. Direct drive DC motors would be best options - allows to operate at high torque at low RPMs

Robot2 - 5DOF manipulator designed to work as assembly robot. Similarly end effector can be a gripper or a spraying gun.
